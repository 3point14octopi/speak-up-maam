  - They say size doesn't matter, but... it kind of does.
  - I want this coffee like your forehead!
  - This coffee reminds me of the Grinch's heart. It should take a hint.
  lowComplain:
  - Hey, I'm not a child!
  - This serving is a little stingy...
  - Please sir, I want some more :(
  highComplain:
  - You know, I think this coffee could afford to have a bit more personality instead
  - Uh... I'm on a diet...
  - This leaves a lot to be desired, but portion size isn't exactly one of them...
  xHighComplain:

  - I asked for a drink, not a caffeinated swimming pool!
  - I'm just soooo small and petite, I can't drink all THAT!
