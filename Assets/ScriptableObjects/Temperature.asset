  - Hey buddy, leave the "frosted" to flakes and cupcakes, okay?
  - Not too bad... if you were born in a snowbank and raised by freakin' penguins!
  - Um... can I get some coffee with this ice?
  lowComplain:
  - 'Do you know how cold it is outside? '
  - Not to be my thermostat-fixated son, but can you turn up the heat a little?
  - I'm already cool enough for my coffee.
  highComplain:
  - I wish you'd chill out, but I'd settle for this coffee...
  - 'This coffee is like a lousy bus seat: uncomfortably warm'
  - Can I get some ice cubes in this?
  xHighComplain:
